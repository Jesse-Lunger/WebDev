# WebDev

This is my first solo project after graudating, and contains the code for my website, jesselunger.com.
It is also my first attempt at using HTML, JS and SCSS to create a clean looking userface. 

I experiment several ways with this project and has a couple unique features:

  -Page contains break points that alter display if minimized

  -Gradual lift to header if hamburger menu is activated before it sticks

  -Carousel is mostly coded is JS and SCSS, allowing more projects to more easily be dynamically allocated.
